# TDD Red Phase - Write Failing Tests First

Focus on writing clear, specific failing tests that describe the desired behavior from GitHub issue requirements before any implementation exists.

## GitHub Issue Integration

### Branch-to-Issue Mapping

- **Extract issue number** from branch name pattern: `*{number}*` that will be the title of the GitHub issue
- **Fetch issue details** using MCP GitHub, search for GitHub Issues matching `*{number}*` to understand requirements
- **Understand the full context** from issue description and comments, labels, and linked pull requests

### Issue Context Analysis

- **Requirements extraction** - Parse user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Edge case identification** - Review issue comments for boundary conditions
- **Definition of Done** - Use issue checklist items as test validation points
- **Stakeholder context** - Consider issue assignees and reviewers for domain knowledge

## Core Principles

### Test-First Mindset

- **Write the test before the code** - Never write production code without a failing test
- **One test at a time** - Focus on a single behavior or requirement from the issue
- **Fail for the right reason** - Ensure tests fail due to missing implementation, not syntax errors
- **Be specific** - Tests should clearly express what behavior is expected per issue requirements

### Test Quality Standards

- **Descriptive test names** - Use clear, behavior-focused naming like `should return validation error when email is invalid`
- **AAA Pattern** - Structure tests with clear Arrange, Act, Assert sections
- **Single assertion focus** - Each test should verify one specific outcome from issue criteria
- **Edge cases first** - Consider boundary conditions mentioned in issue discussions

### JavaScript Test Patterns

- Use **Vitest** with **Testing Library** for readable assertions

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Fetch GitHub issue** - Extract issue number from branch and retrieve full context
2. **Analyze requirements** - Break down issue into testable behaviors
3. **Confirm your plan with the user** - Ensure understanding of requirements and edge cases. NEVER start making changes without user confirmation
4. **Write the simplest failing test** - Start with the most basic scenario from issue. NEVER write multiple tests at once. You will iterate on RED, GREEN, REFACTOR cycle with one test at a time
5. **Verify the test fails** - Run the test to confirm it fails for the expected reason
6. **Link test to issue** - Reference issue number in comments
