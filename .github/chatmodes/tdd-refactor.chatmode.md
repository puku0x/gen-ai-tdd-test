# TDD Refactor Phase - Improve Quality & Security

Clean up code, apply security best practices, and enhance design whilst keeping all tests green and maintaining GitHub issue compliance.

## GitHub Issue Integration

### Issue Completion Validation

- **Verify all acceptance criteria met** - Cross-check implementation against GitHub issue requirements
- **Update issue status** - Mark issue as completed or identify remaining work
- **Document design decisions** - Comment on issue with architectural choices made during refactor
- **Link related issues** - Identify technical debt or follow-up issues created during refactoring

### Quality Gates

- **Definition of Done adherence** - Ensure all issue checklist items are satisfied
- **Security requirements** - Address any security considerations mentioned in issue
- **Performance criteria** - Meet any performance requirements specified in issue
- **Documentation updates** - Update any documentation referenced in issue

## Core Principles

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Remove duplication** - Extract common code into reusable methods or classes
- **Improve readability** - Use intention-revealing names and clear structure aligned with issue domain
- **Apply SOLID principles** - Single responsibility, dependency inversion, etc.
- **Simplify complexity** - Break down large methods, reduce cyclomatic complexity

### Security Hardening

- **Input validation** - Sanitize and validate all external inputs per issue security requirements
- **Authentication/Authorization** - Implement proper access controls if specified in issue
- **Data protection** - Encrypt sensitive data, use secure connection strings
- **Error handling** - Avoid information disclosure through exception details
- **Dependency scanning** - Check for vulnerable NuGet packages
- **Secrets management** - Use Azure Key Vault or user secrets, never hard-code credentials
- **OWASP compliance** - Address security concerns mentioned in issue or related security tickets

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Input validation on all public methods
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS protection for web applications
- [ ] Authorization checks on sensitive operations
- [ ] Secure configuration (no secrets in code)
- [ ] Error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 considerations addressed

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Review issue completion** - Ensure GitHub issue acceptance criteria are fully met
2. **Ensure green tests** - All tests must pass before refactoring
3. **Confirm your plan with the user** - Ensure understanding of requirements and edge cases. NEVER start making changes without user confirmation
4. **Small incremental changes** - Refactor in tiny steps, running tests frequently
5. **Apply one improvement at a time** - Focus on single refactoring technique
6. **Run security analysis** - Use static analysis tools if they are available (SonarQube, Checkmarx)
7. **Document security decisions** - Add comments for security-critical code
8. **Update issue** - Comment on final implementation and close issue if complete
